## Phase 4 Coverage Summary

### What's Tested

✅ **DataProvider Functionality:**
- Static caching mechanism
- HTML select generation
- Data lookup by ID
- Cache reset
- Multiple instance cache sharing
- Edge case handling (unknown IDs, empty data)

✅ **PartnerFormFactory Integration:**
- All partner type rendering (SP, CU, BT, QE, MA, ZZ)
- DataProvider injection via constructor
- Field name generation
- Complete form assembly
- Factory reusability

✅ **HTML Components:**
- HtmlOption: Value/label handling, selection state, escaping
- HtmlSelect: Option management, attributes, fluent interface
- HtmlComment: Comment generation, escaping, modification

### What's NOT Tested (Intentionally)

❌ **Database Integration:**
- Actual database queries (mocked)
- Real data loading from FrontAccounting
- Database error handling

❌ **FrontAccounting Integration:**
- FA function calls (mocked or skipped)
- UI rendering in FA environment
- Session handling

❌ **End-to-End Scenarios:**
- Full page render with 20 items
- Real-world query reduction verification
- Performance benchmarking

**Reason:** Unit tests focus on component logic. Integration/E2E tests would be separate.

---

## Performance Validation

### Query Reduction (Theoretical)

**Baseline (v1.0.0):**
- 20 items × 1 query per partner type dropdown = **20 queries**
- Plus 2 global queries = **22 queries total**

**Phase 4 (v2.0.0):**
- 1 query for suppliers (all items share)
- 1 query for customers (all items share)
- 1 query for branches (all items share)
- 1 query for bank accounts (all items share)
- 1 query for QE_DEPOSIT entries (all items share)
- 1 query for QE_PAYMENT entries (all items share)
- **Total: 6 queries**

**Reduction:** 22 → 6 = **73% fewer queries** ✅

### Memory Cost

**DataProvider Memory:**
- SupplierDataProvider: ~10KB (100 suppliers × 100 bytes)
- CustomerDataProvider: ~15KB (100 customers + 200 branches)
- BankAccountDataProvider: ~5KB (50 accounts)
- QuickEntryDataProvider: ~25KB (100 deposit + 100 payment entries)
- **Total: ~55KB one-time page load**

**Benefit:** Amortized across all 20 line items = **2.75KB per item**
