# Mantis #2708 Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Feature:** Store Uploaded Bank Files  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## What Was Implemented

A complete file storage and management system for uploaded bank statement files, similar to FrontAccounting's document attachment system.

## Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**sql/mantis_2708_uploaded_files.sql**
- Creates `0_bi_uploaded_files` table (file metadata)
- Creates `0_bi_file_statements` table (file-to-statement links)

### 2. Service Class
**src/Ksfraser/FaBankImport/services/UploadedFileManager.php** (~440 lines)
- Saves uploaded files securely
- Links files to statements
- Provides download functionality
- Manages file lifecycle

### 3. Management Interface
**manage_uploaded_files.php** (~280 lines)
- Lists all uploaded files
- Filters (by user, date, parser type)
- Download files
- Delete files
- View file details and linked statements
- Shows storage statistics

### 4. Documentation
**docs/MANTIS_2708_FILE_STORAGE.md** (~700 lines)
- Complete technical documentation
- Usage examples
- SQL queries
- Security details
- Deployment instructions

## Files Modified

### 1. import_statements.php
**Changes:**
- Added `UploadedFileManager` integration
- Saves files during upload process
- Stores file IDs in session
- Links files to statements after import

### 2. hooks.php
**Added menu item:**
```php
$app->add_lapp_function(3, _("Manage Uploaded Files"),
    $path_to_root."/modules/".$this->module_name."/manage_uploaded_files.php", 
    'SA_BANKFILEVIEW', MENU_INQUIRY);
```

### 3. views/module_menu_view.php
**Added navigation link:**
```html
<li><a href="manage_uploaded_files.php">Manage Uploaded Files</a></li>
```

### 4. src/Ksfraser/FaBankImport/views/module_menu_view.php
Updated for consistency

## Key Features

### File Storage
- ✅ Stores files in company-specific directory
- ✅ Generates unique filenames to prevent conflicts
- ✅ Records complete metadata (user, date, size, type)
- ✅ Links files to imported statements
- ✅ Protects directory with .htaccess

### File Management
- ✅ List all uploaded files with pagination
- ✅ Filter by user, date range, parser type
- ✅ Download files securely
- ✅ Delete files (with cascade to links)
- ✅ View file details and linked statements
- ✅ Show storage statistics (total files, total size)

### Security
- ✅ Permission check: `SA_BANKFILEVIEW` (separate from transaction viewing)
- ✅ No direct HTTP access to files
- ✅ Files downloaded through PHP script
- ✅ Validates uploads via `is_uploaded_file()`
- ✅ Sanitizes filenames

### Optional Features (Config)
- ✅ **Duplicate Detection** - Prevents re-uploading same files (default: OFF)
  - Config: `upload.check_duplicates = true` to enable
  - Checks: filename, size, MD5 hash
  - Time window: configurable (default 90 days)
  - **Actions:** 3 modes available
    - `'allow'` - Silent skip (reuse existing file)
    - `'warn'` - Soft deny (prompt user) ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
    - `'block'` - Hard deny (reject upload, force rename)
  - See: `docs/DUPLICATE_CHECKING.md`

## Database Schema

### 0_bi_uploaded_files
```
id, filename, original_filename, file_path, file_size, file_type,
upload_date, upload_user, parser_type, bank_account_id, 
statement_count, notes
```

### 0_bi_file_statements
```
file_id, statement_id
(Links files to statements - many to many)
```

## Menu Access

**Main Menu:** GL → Inquiry → Manage Uploaded Files  
**Module Menu:** Visible on all bank import pages

## Process Flow

```
1. User uploads file(s) via import_statements.php
   ↓
2. File saved to: company/0/bank_imports/
   ↓
3. Record created in bi_uploaded_files
   ↓
4. File parsed and statements imported
   ↓
5. Links created in bi_file_statements
   ↓
6. Files manageable via manage_uploaded_files.php
```

## Storage Location

```
{company_path}/{company_number}/bank_imports/
```

Example:
```
/var/www/frontaccounting/company/0/bank_imports/
  ├── .htaccess (deny all)
  ├── cibc_visa_20251018_143052_a3f9d2e1.qfx
  ├── simplii_20251018_150322_b4e8c3f2.qfx
  └── atb_cc_20251018_152045_d7f2a5b9.qfx
```

## Requirements Met

✅ **"file name"**  
→ Both original and stored filenames tracked

✅ **"upload date"**  
→ `upload_date` field with timestamp

✅ **"upload user"**  
→ `upload_user` field records who uploaded

✅ **"Related Statement(s)"**
