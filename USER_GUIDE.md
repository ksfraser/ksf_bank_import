## Overview

The Paired Bank Transfer Processing system automatically matches and processes transfers between your different bank accounts. When you move money from one account to another (e.g., from Manulife Bank to CIBC HISA), both sides of the transaction are automatically linked and recorded in FrontAccounting with a single click.

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **One-Click Processing** - Process both sides of a transfer with a single button
- ✅ **Automatic Matching** - System finds matching transactions within ±2 days
- ✅ **Zero Duplicate Entries** - Both transactions linked to the same bank transfer record
- ✅ **Visual Confirmation** - Green checkmarks and links to FrontAccounting records
- ✅ **Performance Optimized** - Session caching provides ~95% speed improvement

## What is Paired Transfer Processing?

### Example Scenario

You transfer **$1,000** from your **Manulife Bank** account to your **CIBC HISA** account.

This creates **TWO** separate transactions:
1. **Manulife Bank**: $1,000 withdrawal (Debit) - "TRANSFER TO CIBC HISA"
2. **CIBC HISA**: $1,000 deposit (Credit) - "TRANSFER FROM MANULIFE"

### Traditional Problem
Without paired processing, you would need to:
- Process each transaction separately
- Manually ensure amounts match
- Risk creating duplicate GL entries
- Manually link the transactions

### Paired Processing Solution
With one click, the system:
- Finds the matching transaction automatically
- Determines which account is FROM and which is TO
- Creates a single bank transfer in FrontAccounting
- Updates both transactions as processed
- Links both to the same GL entry

---

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Matching

The system looks for paired transactions based on:

**Criteria:**
- ✅ Same amount (absolute value)
- ✅ Within ±2 days of each other
- ✅ Opposite Debit/Credit indicators (D/C)
- ✅ Each references the other's bank account

**Example:**
```
Transaction 1: Manulife   | Date: Jan 15 | Amount: -$1000 | DC: D | Partner: CIBC
Transaction 2: CIBC HISA  | Date: Jan 16 | Amount: +$1000 | DC: C | Partner: Manulife
                          ↑
                     Within ±2 days ✓
```

### 2. Direction Analysis

The system determines money flow direction automatically:

**Rule:**
- If Transaction 1 is **Debit (D)** → Money leaving → **FROM** = Account 1, **TO** = Account 2
- If Transaction 1 is **Credit (C)** → Money arriving → **FROM** = Account 2, **TO** = Account 1

**Example:**
```
Manulife (DC=D, -$1000)  →  Money LEAVING  →  FROM: Manulife, TO: CIBC
CIBC (DC=C, +$1000)      →  Money ARRIVING →  FROM: Manulife, TO: CIBC
```

### 3. FrontAccounting Integration

Creates a single bank transfer record:
- **Type**: Bank Transfer (ST_BANKTRANSFER)
- **From Account**: Manulife Bank
- **To Account**: CIBC HISA
- **Amount**: $1,000
- **Date**: Jan 15, 2025
- **Memo**: "Paired Transfer: TRANSFER TO CIBC HISA :: TRANSFER FROM MANULIFE"

### 4. Transaction Updates

Both imported transactions are updated:
- **Status**: Changed from 0 (unprocessed) to 1 (processed)
- **FA Link**: trans_no and trans_type recorded
- **Partner Info**: Each transaction stores partner account ID
- **Visual**: Green checkmark (✓) displayed

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Import bank statements from both accounts (Manulife and CIBC)
2. Ensure imported transactions include:
   - Transaction titles/descriptions
   - Amounts (positive or negative)
   - Dates
   - Debit/Credit indicators

### Processing Steps

#### Step 1: Navigate to Process Statements
1. Log into FrontAccounting
2. Go to **Banking → Bank Import → Process Statements**
3. View list of imported transactions (Status Filter: Unprocessed)

#### Step 2: Identify Paired Transactions
Look for transactions that show:
- 🔄 **"Potential Pair"** indicator
- Same absolute amount
- Opposite D/C indicators
- Within ±2 days

**Example Display:**
```
ID    | Date       | Account    | Description           | Amount    | DC | Partner  | Actions
------|------------|------------|----------------------|-----------|----|-----------|-----------------
12345 | 2025-01-15 | Manulife   | TO CIBC HISA         | -$1,000  | D  | CIBC     | [Process Both]
12346 | 2025-01-16 | CIBC HISA  | FROM MANULIFE        | +$1,000  | C  | Manulife | ✓ Paired
```

#### Step 3: Click "Process Both Sides"
1. Click the **[Process Both Sides]** button next to either transaction
2. System automatically:
   - Finds the paired transaction
   - Analyzes direction (FROM/TO)
   - Validates data
   - Creates bank transfer
   - Updates both transactions

#### Step 4: Verify Success
Look for success notification:
```
✓ Paired Bank Transfer Processed Successfully!
Both sides of the transfer have been recorded:
[View GL Entry] ← Click to view in FrontAccounting
```

#### Step 5: Confirm Visual Indicators
Both transactions now show:
- ✅ Green checkmark (✓)
- 🔗 Link to FrontAccounting GL entry
- Partner account displayed
- Status = 1 (Processed)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No paired transaction found"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Partner transaction not imported yet
2. Dates are more than ±2 days apart
3. Amounts don't match
4. Missing partner account reference

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Import statements from both accounts
- ✅ Verify transaction dates are within ±2 days
- ✅ Check amounts match (ignore +/- sign)
- ✅ Ensure transactions reference partner account

### Problem: "Bank account not defined"

**Cause:** The bank account number from the import doesn't match any account in FrontAccounting.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Banking → Bank Accounts**
2. Find the account
3. Verify the **Account Number** matches the import file
4. Update if necessary

### Problem: "Transaction already processed"

**Cause:** One or both transactions were already processed (status=1).

**Solution:**
- Check if transfer was already created in FrontAccounting
- If duplicate, mark transaction as processed manually
- If error, reset status to 0 and reprocess

### Problem: "Direction seems wrong (FROM/TO reversed)"

**Cause:** Debit/Credit (DC) indicators in import file may be reversed for that bank.

**Solution:**
1. Use **Toggle Debit/Credit** button to flip the indicator
2. Reprocess the paired transfer
3. Contact support if issue persists for all transactions from that bank

## FAQ

### Q: Can I process transfers between more than 2 accounts?
**A:** No. The system processes paired transfers (exactly 2 transactions). For multi-leg transfers, process each pair separately.

### Q: What if the dates don't match exactly?
**A:** The system allows ±2 days difference. Transactions from Jan 15 can match with Jan 13-17.

### Q: Can I undo a processed paired transfer?
**A:** You can void the bank transfer in FrontAccounting (GL menu), but you'll need to manually reset the transaction statuses.

### Q: What if I have multiple transfers of the same amount on the same day?
**A:** The system will find the first matching pair. Ensure transaction descriptions are unique or process chronologically.

### Q: Does this work with different currencies?
**A:** The current version expects matching amounts in the same currency. Multi-currency support may be added in future versions.

### Q: What happens if processing fails mid-way?
**A:** The system uses database transactions. If any step fails, everything rolls back (no partial updates).

### Q: Can I customize the operation types?
**A:** Yes! Add custom plugins to the `OperationTypes/` directory implementing `OperationTypeInterface`. The registry will auto-discover them.

### Q: How do I clear the session cache?
**A:** The cache clears automatically when your session expires. Developers can call `VendorListManager::getInstance()->clearCache()`.

### Q: Where can I see the FrontAccounting GL entry?
**A:** Click the **[View GL: type/number]** link next to processed transactions.

### Q: Is there a log of processed transfers?
**A:** Yes. Check the FrontAccounting audit trail under **System → Audit Trail**.
