/*
To create PHPUnit tests for the `process_statements.php` file, 
you will need to focus on creating tests for the `bank_import_controller` class and its methods. 

Since `process_statements.php` mainly uses this controller and performs various operations 
based on $_POST requests, the tests should cover the main functionalities provided by the `bank_import_controller`.

Below is an example of how you might set up PHPUnit tests for the `bank_import_controller` class. 
Note that you will need to adapt this to your specific application and ensure that you have PHPUnit installed and configured.

```php
// File: tests/BankImportControllerTest.php

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;
require_once 'path/to/class.bank_import_controller.php';

class BankImportControllerTest extends TestCase
{
    private $controller;

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->controller = new bank_import_controller();
    }

    public function testUnsetTrans()
    {
        // Simulate $_POST data
        $_POST['UnsetTrans'] = true;

        // Call the method
        $result = $this->controller->unsetTrans();

        // Assert expected results
        $this->assertNotNull($result);
        // Add more specific assertions based on what unsetTrans is supposed to do
    }

    public function testAddCustomer()
    {
        // Simulate $_POST data
        $_POST['AddCustomer'] = true;

        // Call the method
        $result = $this->controller->addCustomer();

        // Assert expected results
        $this->assertNotNull($result);
        // Add more specific assertions based on what addCustomer is supposed to do
    }

    public function testAddVendor()
    {
        // Simulate $_POST data
        $_POST['AddVendor'] = true;

        // Call the method
        $result = $this->controller->addVendor();

        // Assert expected results
        $this->assertNotNull($result);
        // Add more specific assertions based on what addVendor is supposed to do
    }

    public function testToggleDebitCredit()
    {
        // Simulate $_POST data
        $_POST['ToggleTransaction'] = true;

        // Call the method
        $result = $this->controller->toggleDebitCredit();

        // Assert expected results
        $this->assertNotNull($result);
        // Add more specific assertions based on what toggleDebitCredit is supposed to do
    }

    public function testProcessTransaction()
    {
        // Simulate $_POST data
        $_POST['ProcessTransaction'] = [
            'key' => 'value', // Replace with actual key-value pairs expected by the method
        ];

        // Call the method
        $result = $this->controller->processTransaction();

        // Assert expected results
        $this->assertNotNull($result);
        // Add more specific assertions based on what processTransaction is supposed to do
    }

    // Add more tests for other methods as needed
}
/*
In this example, the test class `BankImportControllerTest` is created to test the `bank_import_controller` class. Each method in the controller is tested to ensure it performs the expected operations.

You will need to adapt this to your specific setup:
1. Ensure the paths to `class.bank_import_controller.php` and other dependencies are correct.
2. Add more specific assertions based on the actual behavior and output of each method.
3. Add tests for any other methods in the `bank_import_controller` class.

To run the tests, navigate to the directory containing your tests and run:

phpunit --bootstrap path/to/autoload.php tests/BankImportControllerTest.php

Make sure you have PHPUnit installed and properly configured in your project. You can install PHPUnit via Composer:

composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
