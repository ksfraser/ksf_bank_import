## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Quality Assurance Test Plan defines the testing strategy, approach, resources, and schedule for validating the Paired Transfer Processing enhancement to the KSF Bank Import system.

### 1.2 Objectives

**Quality Objectives:**
- Ensure 100% of critical requirements verified
- Achieve <1% defect escape rate to production
- Maintain 99% test pass rate before release
- Zero critical or high severity bugs in production
- 90%+ user satisfaction in UAT

**Testing Objectives:**
- Validate all functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-018)
- Verify non-functional requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-016)
- Confirm business rules implementation (BR-001 through BR-004)
- Ensure system integration with FrontAccounting
- Validate performance, security, and usability

### 1.3 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of all features
- Integration testing with FrontAccounting
- Performance and load testing
- Security testing
- Usability testing
- Regression testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Out of Scope:**

- Infrastructure/network testing
- Browser compatibility beyond specified versions

---

## 2. Test Strategy

### 2.1 Testing Approach

**V-Model Approach:**
```
Requirements Specification ←→ User Acceptance Testing
    ↓                              ↑
System Design          ←→ System Testing
    ↓                              ↑
Detailed Design        ←→ Integration Testing
    ↓                              ↑
Implementation         ←→ Unit Testing
```

### 2.2 Test Pyramid

```
                 /\
                /  \    10% - Manual E2E Tests
               /____\
              /      \   30% - Integration Tests
             /________\
            /          \ 60% - Unit Tests
           /____________\
```

**Distribution:**
- **Unit Tests (60%):** Automated, fast feedback
- **Integration Tests (30%):** Automated where possible
- **End-to-End Tests (10%):** Manual, UAT scenarios

### 2.3 Testing Principles

1. **Early Testing:** Test from requirements phase
2. **Defect Clustering:** Focus on high-risk areas
3. **Exhaustive Testing Impossible:** Risk-based prioritization
4. **Automation First:** Automate repetitive tests
5. **Context-Dependent:** Testing approach varies by component
6. **Absence-of-Errors Fallacy:** Meeting requirements is key

### 2.4 Entry and Exit Criteria

**Entry Criteria:**
- ✓ Requirements specification approved
- ✓ Test environment set up
- ✓ Test data prepared
- ✓ Code deployed to test environment
- ✓ Unit tests passing (100%)

**Exit Criteria:**
- ✓ All planned test cases executed
- ✓ 99%+ test pass rate
- ✓ Zero critical/high severity open defects
- ✓ All medium severity defects reviewed and accepted
- ✓ Regression testing completed
- ✓ UAT sign-off received
