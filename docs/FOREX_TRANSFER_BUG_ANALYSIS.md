# Forex Transfer Bug Analysis
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Mantis Bug:** #3198  
**Issue:** Exchange variance accumulating (8¢, 16¢, etc.) and extra journal entries being created

---

## Problem Summary

When creating Forex (foreign exchange) funds transfers, you're experiencing:
1. **Accumulating exchange variance** - First transaction shows 8¢ off, next shows 16¢, etc.
2. **Extra journal entries** being created in addition to the main bank transfer entry

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**UPDATE:** User confirmed this bug occurs in the **old BT (Bank Transfer) manual processing path ONLY**, not the new paired processing. This is a forex-specific issue.

### 1. **CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE:** Incorrect Target Amount for Forex Transfers

In `process_statements.php` line 440, the code sets:

```php
$bttrf->set( "amount", $trz['transactionAmount'] );
$bttrf->set( "target_amount", $trz['transactionAmount'] ); // BUG: Same value!
```

**The Problem:**
- For **same-currency transfers** (CAD → CAD): This is correct
- For **forex transfers** (USD → CAD): This is **WRONG**

When transferring from USD account to CAD account:
- `amount` should be the USD amount (e.g., $1000 USD)
- `target_amount` should be the CAD amount after exchange rate (e.g., $1300 CAD)
- But both are set to `$trz['transactionAmount']` which is only ONE side of the transfer

**What FrontAccounting Does:**
1. Receives amount = $1000, target_amount = $1000
2. Looks up exchange rate (e.g., 1.30)
3. Calculates expected target: $1000 × 1.30 = $1300
4. Sees target_amount = $1000 (what you provided)
5. Creates variance entry: $1300 - $1000 = $300 variance
6. Each subsequent transfer accumulates this error

This explains:
- ✅ Why variance accumulates (8¢, 16¢, 24¢...)
- ✅ Why extra GL entries are created (variance entries)
- ✅ Why it only happens with forex transfers
- ✅ Why same-currency transfers work fine

### 2. Exchange Variance Calculation Issue

In `includes.inc` (lines 260-267), there's automatic exchange variance handling:

```php
/*Post a balance post if $total != 0 due to variance in AR and bank posted values*/
if ($total != 0)
{
    $variance_act = get_company_pref('exchange_diff_act');
    add_gl_trans($trans_type_to_use, $payment_no, $date_, $variance_act, 0, 0, '',
        -$total, null, PT_CUSTOMER, $customer_id);
}
```

This creates an additional GL entry when there's a difference between AR and bank values due to exchange rates.

### 3. Target Amount vs Amount Issue

Looking at the bank transfer creation code:

```php
$bttrf->set( "amount", $trz['transactionAmount'] );
$bttrf->set( "target_amount", $trz['transactionAmount'] );
```

**Problem:** When dealing with **forex transfers**, these two amounts should be **different**:
- `amount` = Amount in the SOURCE currency
- `target_amount` = Amount in the DESTINATION currency

**Current code sets them to the SAME value**, which means:
- No exchange rate is being applied
- FrontAccounting's `add_bank_transfer()` function might be calculating exchange variance based on incorrect assumptions
- Each subsequent transfer compounds the error

## Suspected Scenarios

### Scenario A: Double Entry Bug
1. User clicks "Process Both Sides" button → ProcessBothSides code runs
2. Somehow the old BT case is also triggered (possibly through form resubmission or AJAX issue)
3. Result: Two bank transfers created, variances accumulate

### Scenario B: Target Amount Calculation Error
1. Transfer from USD account to CAD account
2. Both `amount` and `target_amount` set to same value (e.g., $1000)
3. FrontAccounting calculates: "Expected CAD: $1300, Got: $1000, Variance: $300"
4. Creates exchange variance JE
5. Next transfer compounds this error

### Scenario C: Cumulative Variance Bug
1. First transfer: 8¢ variance (rounding error)
2. Second transfer: Inherits 8¢ + adds 8¢ = 16¢ variance
3. Third transfer: Inherits 16¢ + adds 8¢ = 24¢ variance
4. This suggests a **state accumulation bug** somewhere

---

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check if Both Paths Are Being Triggered

Add debug logging to both paths:

```php
// In ProcessBothSides section (line ~106)
file_put_contents('/tmp/transfer_debug.log', date('Y-m-d H:i:s') . " - ProcessBothSides triggered for txn: $k\n", FILE_APPEND);

// In old BT case (line ~410)
file_put_contents('/tmp/transfer_debug.log', date('Y-m-d H:i:s') . " - Old BT case triggered for txn: $tid\n", FILE_APPEND);
```

Process a forex transfer and check the log. If you see **both messages** for the same transaction, you have a double-processing bug.

### Step 2: Examine FA Database After Transfer

After creating a forex transfer, check the FrontAccounting database:

```sql
-- Check GL transactions for the transfer
SELECT * FROM 0_gl_trans 
WHERE type = 4 AND type_no = [your_transfer_number]
ORDER BY counter;

-- Check bank transactions
SELECT * FROM 0_bank_trans 
WHERE type = 4 AND trans_no = [your_transfer_number];
```

**Expected:** 2 GL entries (FROM account debit, TO account credit) + 2 bank_trans entries  
**If bug:** 4+ GL entries, extra variance entries

### Step 3: Check Exchange Rate Handling

Review the `fa_bank_transfer` class in `../ksf_modules_common/class.fa_bank_transfer.php`:

Look for:
- How it calculates `target_amount` vs `amount`
- Whether it calls `add_exchange_variation()` function
- Whether it's being called multiple times per transfer

### Step 4: Check for Forex-Specific Logic

Search for exchange rate handling in your forex transfers:

```bash
grep -r "get_exchange_rate" ksf_modules_common/
grep -r "add_exchange_variation" ksf_modules_common/
```

## Recommended Fixes

### ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED: Correct Target Amount for Forex

**File:** `process_statements.php` (lines ~440)

**Final Implementation (Refactored):**
```php
// Calculate target_amount using BankTransferAmountCalculator (handles both same and different currencies)
require_once('Services/BankTransferAmountCalculator.php');
$calculator = new \KsfBankImport\Services\BankTransferAmountCalculator();

$target_amount = $calculator->calculateTargetAmount(
    $bttrf->get("FromBankAccount"),
    $bttrf->get("ToBankAccount"),
    $trz['transactionAmount'],
    $trz['valueTimestamp']
);

$bttrf->set( "target_amount", $target_amount );
```

**What This Fix Does:**
1. Uses `BankTransferAmountCalculator` service (Facade pattern)
2. Service internally:
   - Fetches FROM and TO bank accounts from FrontAccounting
   - Extracts currency codes
   - Uses `ExchangeRateService` to get exchange rate (1.0 for same currency, actual for forex)
   - Calculates target_amount = amount × exchange_rate
3. Returns properly calculated target amount in one simple call

**Architecture:**
- **BankTransferAmountCalculator** (Facade) - Simplifies complex subsystem
  - Handles bank account retrieval
  - Delegates exchange rate logic to ExchangeRateService
- **ExchangeRateService** (SRP) - Single responsibility: get exchange rates
  - Always returns a rate (1.0 or actual)
  - No conditional logic needed in callers

**Expected Results After Fix:**
- ✅ Forex transfers create correct GL entries
- ✅ No exchange variance entries (or correct variance if rate differs from actual)
- ✅ Accumulating variance bug eliminated
- ✅ Same-currency transfers continue to work correctly
- ✅ Clean, testable, maintainable code following SOLID principles

### Fix 1: Ensure Only One Path is Used

**Status:** NOT NEEDED - User confirmed only using old BT path, not paired processing

### Fix 2: Correct Target Amount for Forex

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED ABOVE

### Fix 3: Prevent Variance Accumulation

Check if the exchange variance calculation in `includes.inc` (line 260-267) is being triggered inappropriately:

1. Add logging before creating variance entry
2. Verify that `$total` calculation is correct
3. Ensure variance entries are only created when truly needed

### Fix 4: Add Transaction Locking

Prevent double-processing by locking transactions during processing:

```php
// Before processing
$locked = update_transactions($tid, [], $status=2, 0, 0, false, false, null, ""); // Status 2 = Processing

// After processing (success)
update_transactions($tid, $_cids, $status=1, $trans_no, $trans_type, false, true, "BT", $partnerId);

// After processing (failure)
update_transactions($tid, [], $status=0, 0, 0, false, false, null, ""); // Status 0 = Unprocessed
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Case 1: Single Forex Transfer
1. Clear all pending transactions
2. Import one forex transfer (USD → CAD)
3. Process using "Process Both Sides"
4. Check:
   - How many GL entries created?
   - Is there an exchange variance entry?
   - What's the variance amount?

### Test Case 2: Sequential Forex Transfers
1. Process 3 forex transfers in sequence
2. Record variance for each:
   - Transfer 1: ___¢
   - Transfer 2: ___¢
   - Transfer 3: ___¢
3. Check if variance accumulates

### Test Case 3: Same Currency Transfer
1. Process transfer between same currency accounts (CAD → CAD)
2. Check if variances still occur
3. This will identify if it's forex-specific or general bug

## Questions to Answer

1. **Are you using the new "Process Both Sides" button or the old BT dropdown option?**
   - If using old BT option, variances might be expected behavior
   - If using new "Process Both Sides", this is definitely a bug

2. **What currencies are involved in your forex transfers?**
   - Knowing the currency pair helps test reproduction

3. **Is the exchange variance always exactly 8¢, or does it vary?**
   - Exact 8¢ suggests hardcoded error
   - Varying amounts suggest calculation error

4. **Can you show the GL entries for a problematic transfer?**
   - Post the full GL transaction output to identify extra entries

5. **Is this happening with the new PairedTransferProcessor or the old BT code?**
   - Check which code path is being used

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Add debug logging to identify which code path is executing
2. **Short-term:** Verify if double-processing is occurring
3. **Medium-term:** Implement proper forex target_amount calculation
4. **Long-term:** Consider removing old BT code path if new paired processing handles all cases
