# Optimization Discussion Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Topic:** Page-Level Data Loading for Multiple Line Items

## User Insight

> "This should also apply (load once, use each lineitem) for the Vendor (supplier) list and customer list, bank accounts, etc. Which depends on the Optype..."

## Key Discovery

You're absolutely correct! While we optimized `PartnerSelectionPanel` to cache partner types, the codebase has **additional redundant data loading** that occurs per line item:

### Already Optimized ‚úÖ

1. **Partner Types (`$optypes`)** - Now using `PartnerSelectionPanel::getPartnerTypesArray()` with static caching
2. **Vendor List** - Already using `VendorListManager::getInstance()->getVendorList()` (singleton with session caching)

### NOT Yet Optimized ‚ùå

When each line item renders its partner-type-specific form, these FA helper functions are called **per line item**:

1. **`supplier_list()`** - Queries all suppliers (called for each 'SP' partner type)
2. **`customer_list()`** - Queries all customers (called for each 'CU' partner type)
3. **`customer_branches_list()`** - Queries branches (called for each customer with branches)
4. **`bank_accounts_list()`** - Queries all bank accounts (called for each 'BT' partner type)
5. **`quick_entries_list()`** - Queries quick entries (called for each 'QE' partner type)

## Performance Impact Example

**Scenario:** 20 line items with mixed types (8 suppliers, 5 customers, 4 bank transfers, 2 quick entries, 1 matched)

**Current:** 22 database queries (8 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 2)  
**Optimized:** 5 database queries (load each list once)  
**Improvement:** 77% reduction in queries üöÄ

## Why This Is Harder Than PartnerTypeRegistry

### PartnerSelectionPanel (Easy ‚úÖ)
- Fixed size: 6 partner types
- Small footprint: ~200 bytes
- No external deps: Self-contained
- Already abstracted: Used PartnerTypeRegistry

### Entity Lists (Harder ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Variable size: 100s-1000s of records
- Larger footprint: ~55 KB total
- FA dependencies: Tightly coupled to `db_query()` 
- Not abstracted: FA helpers mix data + HTML generation

## The Root Cause

FA helper functions like `supplier_list()` are **monolithic view helpers** that:
1. Query the database
2. Generate HTML `<select>` elements
3. Return HTML string

This tight coupling prevents:
- Caching the data separately
- Reusing data across multiple line items
- Testing in isolation

## Proposed Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation (‚úÖ Complete)
- Created `PAGE_LEVEL_DATA_LOADING_STRATEGY.md`
- Analyzed performance impact
- Documented architectural constraints

### Phase 2: Data Provider Classes (Next Session)
Create wrapper classes that separate data from presentation:

```php
class SupplierDataProvider
{
    private static ?array $cachedSuppliers = null;
    
    public static function getAll(): array {
        // Cache suppliers on first call
    }
    
    public static function generateSelectHtml(string $fieldName, $selectedId): string {
        // Use cached data to generate HTML
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Integration with PartnerFormFactory
When extracting `PartnerFormFactory`, design it to:
1. Accept data providers as dependencies (DI)
2. Support both old FA helpers (backward compat) and new providers
3. Use feature flags for gradual migration

## Implementation Approach

### For PartnerFormFactory Extraction (Current Focus)

**Strategy:** Maintain backward compatibility while preparing for optimization

```php
class PartnerFormFactory
{
    // Accept rendered HTML or use FA helpers directly
    public function renderSupplierForm(int $lineItemId, $selectedId): string
    {
        // For now, call FA helper (keeps existing behavior)
        // But document that this should be optimized
        return supplier_list("partnerId_$lineItemId", $selectedId, false, false);
    }
}
```

**Documentation:**
- Add PHPDoc noting: "TODO: Optimize using SupplierDataProvider"
- Add comments explaining the redundancy
- Reference PAGE_LEVEL_DATA_LOADING_STRATEGY.md

### For Future Sessions (Data Providers)

1. Implement `SupplierDataProvider` with tests
2. Add static caching (similar to PartnerSelectionPanel)
3. Measure actual performance improvement
4. Create opt-in feature flag
5. Gradually migrate other providers

## Memory vs Performance Trade-off

**Cost:** ~55 KB additional RAM per request  
**Benefit:** 15-20 fewer database queries  
**Time saved:** 75-400ms per page load  

**Conclusion:** Memory is cheap, time is expensive ‚úÖ

## Architectural Principle Established

> **"Load once at page level, reuse for all line items"**

Applied to:
- ‚úÖ Partner types (PartnerSelectionPanel v1.1.0)
- ‚úÖ Vendor list (VendorListManager - already exists)
- ‚è≥ Suppliers, Customers, Bank Accounts, Quick Entries (planned)

## Next Steps

1. **Continue PartnerFormFactory extraction** with awareness of this optimization need
2. **Document the TODO** in code comments and PHPDoc
3. **Plan DataProvider implementation** for next refactoring session
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** throughout transition

## Key Takeaway

Your observation identified a **systemic performance issue** across the entire line item rendering system. The PartnerSelectionPanel optimization was just the beginning - there's much more potential for improvement by applying the same "load once, use many" pattern to all entity lists.

This is a perfect example of how understanding the **full data flow** reveals optimization opportunities that aren't obvious when looking at individual components in isolation. üéØ
